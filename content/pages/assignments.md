Doing a Coolhunt/Social Network Analysis of Your Own
----------------------------------------------------

This is an individual project as a precursor to the team project, applying the Condor social network analysis and Web coolhunting tools on a topic of your choice. You have two options:

1.  Doing an in-depth analysis of your own mailbox, to uncover the key influencers in your own social network, similar to the examples introduced in class.
2.  Applying the coolhunting blueprint introduced in class, do a Web trend monitoring and analysis task on a topic of your own choice.

You can do this project either by yourself, or at most in teams of two. You need to have chosen the topic at the latest by Ses #6. It is due Ses #12. As part of the project, you will also get an individual task (the midterm exam on Ses #12), to be done individually, but in the classroom, without the instructor present.

Presenting a Research Paper in Class
------------------------------------

In teams of three, you are asked to present one of these topics and its associated three to four papers in class (about a 30 minute presentation) putting it in perspective with latest trends and developments, and lead a 60 minute discussion with your classmates.
